## 🧬 GENOTYPE DETERMINATION LOGIC

### The Two Key SNPs:

| SNP | Position | Your Bases | Amino Acid | Result |
|-----|----------|------------|------------|--------|
| rs429358 | chr19:45411941 | **T/T** | Arg112 | ε4 |
| rs7412 | chr19:45412079 | **C/C** | Arg158 | ε4 |

### APOE Allele Key:
- **ε2:** rs429358=C + rs7412=T (Cys112, Cys158)
- **ε3:** rs429358=C + rs7412=C (Cys112, Arg158)  
- **ε4:** rs429358=T + rs7412=C (Arg112, Arg158) ← **YOUR GENOTYPE**

**Your combination:** T + C = **ε4** on both chromosomes = **ε4/ε4**

## 📊 VCF VARIANT CALLING RESULTS

From BCFtools analysis (200bp region around key SNPs):

```
Position rs429358 (45411941):
GT:PL    0/0:0    (Homozygous reference = T/T)
Quality: 131.995  (Very high confidence)
Depth:   34       (Excellent coverage)
MQ:      60       (Maximum mapping quality)

Position rs7412 (45412079):
GT:PL    0/0:0    (Homozygous reference = C/C)  
Quality: 59.9942  (High confidence)
Depth:   9        (Adequate coverage)
MQ:      60       (Maximum mapping quality)
```

**Interpretation:**
- `0/0` = Homozygous reference (both alleles match reference)
- Reference = T at rs429358 and C at rs7412
- Therefore: Your genotype = T/T and C/C = **ε4/ε4**

## ⚠️ CLINICAL CONTEXT

While your genotype is scientifically validated, remember:

### What ε4/ε4 means:
- ✅ Increases Alzheimer's risk (~8-12x average)
- ✅ But 45-70% of ε4/ε4 carriers NEVER get Alzheimer's
- ✅ NOT a diagnosis or prediction
- ✅ Risk is modifiable through lifestyle

### What to do:
1. **Consult genetic counselor** (most important!)
2. **Focus on brain-healthy lifestyle:**
   - Regular exercise (most protective factor)
   - Mediterranean/MIND diet
   - Cognitive engagement
   - Social connections
   - Cardiovascular health
   - Quality sleep
3. **Stay informed** about prevention research
4. **Don't panic** - knowledge is power
5. **Consider research participation**

---

## 📞 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ **Read full report:** `HRR024685_apoe_report.txt`
2. ✅ **Consult genetic counselor:** For proper interpretation
3. ✅ **Discuss with doctor:** About monitoring and prevention
4. ✅ **Implement lifestyle changes:** Exercise, diet, sleep
5. ✅ **Stay positive:** Many ε4/ε4 carriers live healthy lives
