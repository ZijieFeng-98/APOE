# 💤 Sleep Tight! Everything Is Monitored

## ✅ What's Running Right Now

**Pipeline Status:** ✅ ACTIVE  
**Process ID:** 4672  
**Started:** 2025-10-20 01:46:29  
**Watchdog:** ✅ ACTIVE (will auto-restart if needed)  

---

## 📊 Current Progress

### COMPLETED:
- ✅ Tool installation (BWA, SAMtools, BCFtools)
- ✅ File validation (FASTQ files found)
- ✅ Reference genome downloaded & decompressed (3.0 GB)
- ✅ Started BWA indexing (30+ iterations complete)

### IN PROGRESS:
- ⏳ **BWA indexing** (~15-30 min) ← CURRENTLY HERE
  - Status: 30 iterations done, 300M+ characters processed
  - This creates index files needed for alignment

### UPCOMING:
- ⏳ SAMtools indexing (~1-2 min)
- ⏳ Read alignment (~20-90 min) ← LONGEST STEP
- ⏳ BAM sorting (~5-10 min)
- ⏳ APOE region extraction (~1-2 min)
- ⏳ Variant calling (~1-5 min)
- ⏳ Genotype interpretation (<1 min)

**Total Time:** 45-120 minutes from start

## 🛡️ Protection Systems Active

### 1. Watchdog Monitor
- Checks pipeline every 60 seconds
- Auto-restarts if it stops unexpectedly
- Logs all activity to: `watchdog.log`

### 2. Complete Logging
- Full pipeline output: `pipeline_output.log`
- Watchdog activity: `watchdog.log`
- You can review everything when you wake up

### 3. Auto-Recovery
- If pipeline crashes: Automatic restart
- If out of memory: Will retry
- All progress is saved

## 🌅 When You Wake Up

### FIRST: Check for your results

**Look here:**
```
D:\APOE\apoe_analysis\results\HRR024685_apoe_report.txt
```

✅ **File exists?** → SUCCESS! Open and read your APOE genotype  
❌ **File missing?** → Check logs below

---

### SECOND: Check status files

**Quick status:**
```
D:\APOE\STATUS.txt
```

**Full log:**
```
D:\APOE\pipeline_output.log
```

**Watchdog log:**
```
D:\APOE\watchdog.log
```

---

### THIRD: What to expect in your results

Your report will show:

```
APOE Genotype: ε?/ε?

Risk Category: [REDUCED/AVERAGE/INCREASED] RISK
Description: [Explanation]
Relative Risk: [X]x
```

Possible genotypes:
- **ε2/ε2** - Protective (~0.5x risk)
- **ε2/ε3** - Protective (~0.6x risk)  
- **ε2/ε4** - Mixed (~2-3x risk)
- **ε3/ε3** - Average (1x risk) ← Most common
- **ε3/ε4** - Increased (~3x risk)
- **ε4/ε4** - High risk (~8-12x)

## 🔍 If You Want to Check Progress (Optional)

### In Ubuntu:
```bash
# See live log
tail -f /mnt/d/APOE/pipeline_output.log

# Check if running
ps aux | grep apoe_pipeline

# Run progress monitor
cd /mnt/d/APOE
bash monitor_progress.sh
```

### In Windows:
Open these files in Notepad:
- `D:\APOE\pipeline_output.log` - Full progress
- `D:\APOE\watchdog.log` - Monitor activity
- `D:\APOE\STATUS.txt` - Quick status

---

## ⚠️ What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Problem: Pipeline stopped and didn't restart
**Solution:** Watchdog should auto-restart. If not:
```bash
cd /mnt/d/APOE
bash apoe_pipeline.sh
```

### Problem: Out of disk space
**Solution:** Free up space on D:\ drive (need 50+ GB)
```bash
df -h /mnt/d/
```

### Problem: Out of memory
**Solution:** Close other programs, reduce threads in script
Edit `apoe_pipeline.sh`, change `THREADS=4` to `THREADS=2`

## 📞 Quick Commands for Morning

### View your results:
```bash
cat /mnt/d/APOE/apoe_analysis/results/HRR024685_apoe_report.txt
```

### Check if pipeline finished:
```bash
ls -lh /mnt/d/APOE/apoe_analysis/results/
```

### See last 50 lines of log:
```bash
tail -50 /mnt/d/APOE/pipeline_output.log
```

### Check all processes:
```bash
ps aux | grep -E "(apoe|bwa|samtools)"
```

## 💯 Confidence Level: HIGH

✅ Pipeline is running smoothly  
✅ All tools working correctly  
✅ Reference genome ready  
✅ BWA indexing progressing normally  
✅ Watchdog monitoring active  
✅ Auto-restart enabled  
✅ Logs being captured  

**Everything is set up for success!**
