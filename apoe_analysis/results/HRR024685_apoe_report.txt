Sample ID: HRR024685
Analysis Date: 2025-10-20
Reference: GRCh37/hg19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAW GENOTYPE DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rs429358 (chr19:45411941):
  Reference: T
  Genotype: T/T
  Coverage: 34x
  Note: Homozygous for T allele (Arg at position 112)

rs7412 (chr19:45412079):
  Reference: C
  Genotype: C/C
  Coverage: 9x
  Note: Homozygous for C allele (Arg at position 158)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APOE GENOTYPE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APOE Genotype: ε4/ε4

Allele Interpretation:
  ε4 = T at rs429358 + C at rs7412 (Arg112, Arg158)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLINICAL INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risk Category: SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RISK

Description: Substantially increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. This is the 
highest-risk APOE genotype.

Relative Risk: ~8-12x (eight to twelve times the average population risk)

Frequency: Rare (~2% of the population has ε4/ε4 genotype)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. APOE genotype is just ONE of many risk factors for Alzheimer's disease

2. Having ε4/ε4 does NOT mean you will definitely develop Alzheimer's
   - Many people with ε4/ε4 never develop the disease
   - Age of onset varies greatly
   - Other genetic and environmental factors play crucial roles

3. Protective factors that may help:
   - Regular physical exercise
   - Mediterranean diet
   - Cognitive stimulation and lifelong learning
   - Social engagement
   - Management of cardiovascular risk factors
   - Adequate sleep
   - Stress management

4. This information is for RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY
   - NOT a clinical diagnosis
   - NOT a prediction of disease
   - Should NOT be used for medical decisions without proper counseling

5. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Consult a genetic counselor or physician who 
   specializes in neurogenetics for proper interpretation and guidance

6. Consider:
   - Regular cognitive monitoring as you age
   - Discussion with healthcare provider about preventive strategies
   - Participation in research studies (if interested)
   - Lifestyle modifications that support brain health

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APOE ε4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Key Statistics for ε4/ε4 carriers:
- ~8-12x increased risk compared to ε3/ε3
- Earlier average age of onset (if disease develops)
- ~30-55% lifetime risk of Alzheimer's by age 85
- But 45-70% of ε4/ε4 carriers do NOT develop Alzheimer's

The ε4 allele affects:
- Amyloid-beta metabolism and clearance
- Lipid transport in the brain
- Neuroinflammation
- Synaptic function

However, risk is modifiable through:
- Lifestyle interventions
- Cardiovascular health maintenance
- Cognitive engagement
- Early intervention strategies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUALITY METRICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coverage at key positions:
  rs429358: 34x (excellent)
  rs7412: 9x (adequate for genotype calling)

Sequencing Quality: Good
Confidence Level: High

All reads at both positions consistently matched the reference genome,
indicating homozygous genotypes at both loci.
