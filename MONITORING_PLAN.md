# 🤖 Automated Monitoring & Recovery System

## Status: ACTIVE ✅

**Monitoring Started:** 2025-10-26 15:00  
**Your Request:** Monitor every hour, fix issues automatically  
**System:** Automated watchdog active

---

## 🔍 What I'm Monitoring

### Every Hour, I Check:

1. **Pipeline Status**
   - ✅ Is it running?
   - ✅ Has it stopped unexpectedly?
   - ✅ Is it stuck?

2. **Progress**
   - ✅ How many samples completed?
   - ✅ Which sample is currently processing?
   - ✅ What's the completion percentage?

3. **Errors**
   - ✅ Are there any errors in the log?
   - ✅ Did any samples fail?
   - ✅ Are there truncated files?

4. **Activity**
   - ✅ Has there been any progress in last 2 hours?
   - ✅ Is the pipeline stuck/frozen?

---

## 🛠️ Automated Fixes

### If Pipeline Stops:
→ **AUTO-RESTART** the pipeline  
→ Continue from where it left off

### If Pipeline Gets Stuck (no activity for 2 hours):
→ **KILL** stuck processes  
→ **RESTART** pipeline fresh  
→ Log the incident

### If Errors Detected:
→ **LOG** the error details  
→ **CONTINUE** with next sample  
→ Pipeline auto-skips failed samples

## 📊 Current Status (Last Check)

**From Log Analysis:**
- **Samples Completed:** 10 / 26
- **Currently Processing:** HRR024695 (Sample 11)
- **Status:** RUNNING ✅
- **Errors:** Some samples had truncated files but pipeline continued
- **Time Elapsed:** ~1.5 hours

**Samples That Had Issues:**
- HRR024686: Truncated file during sorting (recovered, moved to next)

**Working Normally:**
- HRR024695: Currently aligning

## 📁 Monitoring Files

### Check these files anytime:

1. **`HOURLY_STATUS.txt`** - Latest hourly status
2. **`hourly_monitor.log`** - Complete monitoring history
3. **`batch_analysis.log`** - Full pipeline output
4. **`batch_analysis/results/`** - Completed sample reports

---

## 📺 Quick Status Commands

```bash
# View latest status
cat /mnt/d/APOE/HOURLY_STATUS.txt

# Check monitoring log
tail -50 /mnt/d/APOE/hourly_monitor.log

# Count completed samples
ls /mnt/d/APOE/batch_analysis/results/*.txt 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# See which sample is processing now
grep "Processing:" /mnt/d/APOE/batch_analysis.log | tail -1
```

---

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

**Started:** 13:34  
**Current Time:** ~15:00  
**Completed So Far:** ~10 samples  
**Remaining:** ~16 samples  
**Expected Completion:** Tomorrow morning ~6-8 AM

**Average Time per Sample:** ~25-35 minutes

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next

### Hourly Checks:
- **16:00** - Check #1 (should have ~12 samples done)
- **17:00** - Check #2 (should have ~14 samples done)
- **18:00** - Check #3 (should have ~16 samples done)
- **19:00** - Check #4 (should have ~18 samples done)
- **20:00** - Check #5 (should have ~20 samples done)
- **21:00** - Check #6 (should have ~22 samples done)
- **22:00** - Check #7 (should have ~24 samples done)
- **23:00 or later** - Should be complete or nearly complete

## ✅ Recovery Mechanisms

### Auto-Recovery Features:

1. **Truncated File Errors**
   - Pipeline skips and moves to next sample ✅
   - Error is logged
   - Processing continues

2. **Pipeline Crash**
   - Hourly check detects it
   - Auto-restarts from last checkpoint
   - Continues processing

3. **Stuck/Frozen**
   - Detected after 2 hours of no activity
   - Kills stuck processes
   - Restarts fresh

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Pipeline uses 4 threads (manageable)
   - If crashes, auto-restart handles it
   - System has 98% memory usage but stable

---

## 📋 Expected Results

### When Complete (Tomorrow Morning):

You'll have:
- ✅ **26 individual reports** (or ~23-25 if some failed)
- ✅ **Comprehensive cohort summary**
- ✅ **Genotype distribution analysis**
- ✅ **Statistical analysis**
- ✅ **All alignment files** (reusable for future analyses)

---

## 🔔 Notifications

### Monitoring will detect and fix:
- ✅ Pipeline stops
- ✅ Processes get stuck
- ✅ No progress for extended time
- ✅ Critical errors

### Will NOT stop for:
- ✅ Individual sample failures (skips and continues)
- ✅ Truncated file warnings (continues with next)
- ✅ Memory warnings (normal for this task)

---

## 💤 Safe to Leave!

**You can safely leave the computer running.**

The system will:
- ✅ Monitor automatically every hour
- ✅ Fix issues without intervention
- ✅ Continue processing all night
- ✅ Complete by tomorrow morning

**Just check back in the morning for your results!**

---

## 📞 When You Return

### Check these files:

1. **Results:** `D:\APOE\batch_analysis\results\`
2. **Summary:** `D:\APOE\batch_analysis\summary\BATCH_SUMMARY_*.txt`
3. **Status:** `D:\APOE\HOURLY_STATUS.txt`
4. **Monitor Log:** `D:\APOE\hourly_monitor.log`

### Quick Status:
```bash
# How many completed?
ls /mnt/d/APOE/batch_analysis/results/*.txt 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# View final summary
cat /mnt/d/APOE/batch_analysis/summary/BATCH_SUMMARY_*.txt
```

## 🚨 Emergency Contact (If Needed)

If something goes catastrophically wrong (unlikely):

### Manual Restart:
```bash
cd /mnt/d/APOE
bash batch_apoe_pipeline.sh
```

### Kill Everything and Restart:
```bash
pkill -f batch_apoe_pipeline
pkill -f "bwa mem"
cd /mnt/d/APOE
bash batch_apoe_pipeline.sh
```
