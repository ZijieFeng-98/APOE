## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Automatic (Easiest)

1. **Open Ubuntu** (from Start menu)
2. **Run this one command**:
```bash
cd /mnt/d/APOE && bash setup_and_run.sh
```
3. **Enter password when prompted**: `980306FZj@`
4. **Wait 30-120 minutes**
5. **Done!** View results at: `D:\APOE\apoe_analysis\results\HRR024685_apoe_report.txt`

### Method 2: Step-by-Step (More Control)

1. **Open Ubuntu** (from Start menu)
2. **Install tools**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y bwa samtools bcftools wget
```
3. **Run pipeline**:
```bash
cd /mnt/d/APOE
./apoe_pipeline.sh
```
4. **View results**:
```bash
cat apoe_analysis/results/HRR024685_apoe_report.txt
```

## 📊 What You'll Get

Your report will tell you:

✅ **Your APOE Genotype** (one of):
- ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε2/ε4
- ε3/ε3, ε3/ε4
- ε4/ε4

✅ **Alzheimer's Disease Risk**:
- Reduced risk (ε2 alleles)
- Average risk (ε3/ε3)
- Increased risk (ε4 alleles)

✅ **Clinical Interpretation**:
- Relative risk compared to population average
- Explanation of your genotype
- Important disclaimers

## 💾 Disk Space

Make sure you have **50-100 GB free** on D:\ drive

Check with:
```bash
df -h /mnt/d/
```

## 🔬 The Science

The pipeline analyzes **two SNPs** that define APOE alleles:

1. **rs429358** (chr19:45411941, C>T)
2. **rs7412** (chr19:45412079, C>T)

**APOE Allele Definitions**:
- **ε2** = rs429358:C + rs7412:T (protective)
- **ε3** = rs429358:C + rs7412:C (neutral, most common)
- **ε4** = rs429358:T + rs7412:C (risk factor)

**Alzheimer's Risk by Genotype**:
- ε2/ε2: ~0.5x (protective)
- ε2/ε3: ~0.6x (protective)
- ε3/ε3: 1x (average)
- ε3/ε4: ~3x (increased)
- ε4/ε4: ~8-12x (significantly increased)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- APOE is just **ONE** of many risk factors
- Having ε4 does **NOT** mean you'll get Alzheimer's
- Many people with ε4/ε4 never develop the disease
- This is for **research purposes only**
- Consult a **genetic counselor** for clinical interpretation

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"
- Make sure you're in Ubuntu terminal (not PowerShell)
- Install tools: `sudo apt install -y bwa samtools bcftools`

### "No space left on device"
- Free up space on D:\ drive (need 50+ GB)
- Check: `df -h /mnt/d/`

### "Permission denied"
- Make executable: `chmod +x apoe_pipeline.sh`

### Pipeline is slow
- This is normal! Alignment takes time
- Expected: 30-120 minutes total
- You can leave it running and come back

### Download fails
- Check internet connection
- Pipeline will retry automatically
- Or download reference manually (see INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md)
