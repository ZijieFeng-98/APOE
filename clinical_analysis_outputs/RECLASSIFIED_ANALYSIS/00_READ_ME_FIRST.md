‚ö†Ô∏è **Œµ2/Œµ3 worst survival:** 16.9 months (all 6 died)  
‚úÖ **Œµ3/Œµ3 intermediate:** 24.0 months median  
üìä **Male gender:** 2.2-2.7√ó increased death hazard

## üéØ For Your Meeting with Dr. Guo

### **üìÇ Open These Files:**

1. **APOE Distribution:**
   - `apoe_grade_distribution_RECLASSIFIED.png`
   
2. **Survival Analysis:**
   - `survival_IDH_WT_by_APOE.png`
   - `survival_IDH_WT_by_treatment.png`

3. **Detailed Summary:**
   - `IDH_WT_SURVIVAL_SUMMARY.md`

### **üí¨ Key Message:**

> "We analyzed 25 patients with APOE genotypes. For survival analysis, we focused on the 20 IDH-wildtype (true GBM) patients. Remarkably, all 3 APOE Œµ4 carriers are alive, suggesting a possible protective effect in GBM‚Äîopposite of Alzheimer's disease. This finding approaches statistical significance (p=0.08) despite our small sample size and warrants validation in larger cohorts."

## ‚úÖ Why Focused on IDH-WT for Survival?

**Scientific Rationale:**
1. **IDH-WT = True GBM:** These are the biologically aggressive tumors
2. **Homogeneous Cohort:** More meaningful to analyze survival in uniform group
3. **Clinical Relevance:** GBM patients need prognostic markers
4. **Statistical Power:** Focusing on one group increases power

**What We Did:**
- ‚úÖ APOE distribution: All 25 patients (to show full cohort)
- ‚úÖ Survival analysis: IDH-WT only (n=20, true GBM)
- ‚úÖ Cox regression: IDH-WT only (n=20)
- ‚úÖ Treatment analysis: IDH-WT only (n=20)

## üîë Key Numbers to Remember

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Patients** | 25 |
| **IDH-Wildtype (GBM)** | 20 |
| **Œµ4 Carriers (IDH-WT)** | 3 (all alive!) |
| **Œµ2/Œµ3 Survival** | 16.9 months (worst) |
| **Œµ3/Œµ3 Survival** | 24.0 months |
| **Œµ4 Carriers Survival** | Not reached (best) |

## üöÄ Next Steps After Meeting

1. **If Dr. Guo approves:**
   - Validate Œµ4 effect in TCGA/CGGA
   - Extend follow-up for Œµ4 carriers
   - Prepare manuscript

2. **Additional Analyses:**
   - APOE expression (RNA-seq)
   - Immune profiling by APOE
   - Mechanistic studies

3. **Clinical Application:**
